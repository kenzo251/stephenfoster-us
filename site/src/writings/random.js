#### Dev log

* 9/14/2022 - Made the text visible on top of the homepage image tiles.  TODO: Bring back about me tile!  Added sc2 tile to homepage.  Added images on the content landing pages.
* 9/13/2022 - Made website tiles have pictures only.  Still not sure if this is the best (maybe add back the titles?).  Might need some A/B tests.  Oops lost the about me...  TODO: Add in fade
* 9/12/2022 - Switched to darkmode.  Learned that it takes a long time to add a new top-level tile to the homepage, should shorten this process (but should decide first how much content deserves a full tile...).  TODO: Maybe make a script.  Started a wiki on the [random](/#/random) page.  Considered that maybe a wiki would make a better homepage, or at least that the homepage could have more text on it...
