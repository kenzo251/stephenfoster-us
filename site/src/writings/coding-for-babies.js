Now that we've all done an Hour of Code or two,
we can all collectively agree on two things: 1) coding is the hip new way to use the computer, and
2) you're never too young to start doing it. That's why I'm announcing my EdTech company's
new initiative: "Coding for Babies." Read on to hear about 5 HOT NEW PRODUCTS that bring coding
education out of college lecture halls and into the cradle.

### 1. BASIC programming language

With Baby All-purpose Symbolic Instructional Code (aka "BASIC"), 
we've created a programming language whose syntax is so easy that even a baby can use it! 
Here's how to get our COPA-compliant, at-home BASIC interpreter as 
soon as possible:

1. Purchase our patented BASIC BabyCam, connect it to your WIFI, download our BASIC BabyCam Mobile App, and sign in with your Facebook, Google, Instagram, or TikTok account(s).

2. Point the BASIC BabyCam directly at your baby.

3. Sit back and let our machine learning algorithms begin building your baby's unique BabyLanguageᵀᴹ Model.	

Within minutes, your BASIC BabyCam will start detecting over 1,000 unique sounds, 
facial expressions, and gestures that can be used to write programs! What you see is 
"your baby being a baby," but what the BASIC BabyCam sees is BabyLanguageᵀᴹ like this:

\`\`\`
  [Burble] 
  [Cry]
  [Babble]
  [Grimace]
  [Burble again]
  [Squirm]
  [Fart]
  [Smile]
\`\`\`

What now, you ask? When the LED beneath the BASIC BabyCam's watchful eye turns from red to yellow, you can use your BASIC BabyCam Mobile App to:

1. See what your baby is saying in BabyLanguageᵀᴹ (even when you're not at home!)

2. Upgrade your account to the Silver or Gold level! 

3. Configure your baby's ad preferences if you choose not to upgrade! (More on this later.)
	 
Either way, when night falls, the fun begins. Put your child to bed like normal, taking care that the BASIC BabyCam is still pointed directly at your baby. While you sleep, the BASIC BabyCam will be helping your baby take their first steps as a software engineer with  our science-inspired, AI-driven HelloWorldᵀᴹ Curriculum.


### 2. HelloWorldᵀᴹ Curriculum

At some point during the night, the BASIC BabyCam's LED will turn from yellow to green. This means the education has begun.

Whenever a \`[Smile]\` is detected, you may hear a particularly pleasant noise like \`*beep boop!*\` 
emitted from the BASIC BabyCam's speakers. Likewise, when a \`[Grimace]\` is detected, an unpleasant 
noise like \`*wamp wamp!!*\` will play. 

Within a few hours, the BASIC BabyCam can often induce a \`[Smile]\` or a \`[Grimace]\` simply by 
playing the associated noise. You might wonder, 
"Is my baby programming the BASIC BabyCam? Or is it the other way around?" 
The answer is: it's both!


> Side note for Bronze users: When your baby does a [Smile], you may occasionally hear 
the BASIC BabyCam whisper things like, "Silly Rabbit, Trix are for kids" and other 
messages from our advertising partners. 

> Don't worry. The ads will not hinder your baby's coding education 
(and in many cases may improve it!) 

Most babies are able to write a "Hello, World" program within their first night of coding education. 
Here's how it works!

The BASIC BabyCam will chose two of your baby's unique BabyLanguageᵀᴹ expressions 
(such as \`[Babble]\` and \`[Burble]\`) to represent the two most important syntactic building 
blocks of BASIC programs. Whenever your baby does a \`[Babble]\` followed by a \`[Burble]\`, your 
baby will receive a \`*beep boop!*\` and will begin to \`[Smile]\`. Note that your baby will also 
be rewarded for a \`[Babble]\` followed by a \`[Burble]\` even if there are other 
BabyLanguageᵀᴹ expressions in between. For example:


\`\`\`
[Babble]
  [Fart]
  [Fart]
[Burble]
--------
*beep boop!* / [Smile]
\`\`\`


Indeed, as long the BASIC BabyCam can detect a \`[Burble]\` for every \`[Babble]\`, your baby 
will receive a \`*beep boop!*\` and will \`[Smile]\`, i.e.:

\`\`\`
[Babble]
  [Fart]
  [Fart]
  [Babble]
    [Cry]
    [Squirm]
  [Burble]
[Burble]
--------
*beep boop!* / [Smile]
\`\`\`


But if BASIC BabyCam doesn't detect a matching \`[Burble]\` for a \`[Babble]\` within a minute or 
two, a \`*wamp wamp!!*\` will be played:

\`\`\`
[Babble]
  [Fart]
  [Fart]
  [Babble]
    [Cry]
    [Squirm]
  [Burble]
  [Long Silence]
--------
*wamp wamp!!* / [Grimace]
\`\`\`

As your baby becomes more and more skilled at matching their \`[Babbles]\` with their \`[Burbles]\`, 
the chances of your baby creating a syntactically correct program rise dramatically. 
It's only a matter of time before your baby accidentally writes  a program like the following:


\`\`\`
[Babble]
  [Squirm]
  [Wave]
[Burble]
\`\`\`

Congratulations! Your baby just wrote a "Hello, World!" program! This event will be recorded, timestamped, and saved in your gallery forever. 
When you wake, the LCD screen of the BASIC BabyCam will be showing a looping video of your baby waving at you. Indeed, whenever your baby writes a program of the following form…

\`\`\`
[Babble]
  [Squirm]
  [*]
[Burble]
\`\`\`


…the BASIC BabyCam (whose watchful eye is always recording) will save the footage of 
\`[*]\` to your gallery and begin playing it on the LCD screen. This \`[*]\` could be anything 
from a \`[Wave]\` to \`[Fart]\` to \`[Smile]\`, depending on your baby's creative inclinations.

When you finish celebrating your baby's first program, please remember that learning to code is 
a life-long journey. One night of coding education as a baby will not be enough to ensure that your 
baby grows up to be eligible for the competitive, high-paying software jobs of Silicon Valley. 

But if you keep the BASIC BabyCam pointed directly at your baby at all times, you'll never again 
be forced to go to sleep worrying about your child's future. 

> Keep reading to see why some companies in Silicon Valley are doing away with interviews 
and resumes altogether, choosing instead to hire talent based on the raw number of hours a 
BASIC BabyCam was pointed directly at the applicant during childhood.


### 3. BraveNewBabyᵀᴹ Curriculum

Naturally, programs like \`[Babble][Squirm][Wave][Burble]\` will be written accidentally at 
first. Your baby won't know they're coding for a few years, but the BASIC BabyCam doesn't mind 
being programmed by a baby that doesn't know what programming is.

What's important is that this critical formative period (in which your baby can't tell the 
difference between coding and just existing) is no time to waste! Remember, the baby next door 
also has a BASIC BabyCam. So does the one down the street. Your baby cannot afford to just lie 
there when so many other babies are busy learning to code.

The BraveNewBabyᵀᴹ Curriculum will kick in automatically.

For example, when your baby does a [Smile], the BASIC BabyCam might quietly whisper sound clips 
by one or more famous  computer scientists:

* "Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes." ~Edsger Dijkstra

* "The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise." ~Edsger Dijkstra

* "Teaching COBOL ought to be regarded as a criminal act." ~Edsger Dijkstra

> Side note for Bronze users: The shortest path to getting the BASIC BabyCam to play quotes from anyone other than Edsger Dijkstra would be to upgrade to the Silver or Gold levels. This will also allow you to disable ads.

At first, your baby won't understand these quietly whispered quotes any more than they 
understand "Silly Rabbit, Trix are for kids." But after years of training with the BASIC BabyCam, 
they'll grow up to realize that these Edsger Dijkstra pearls make them happy for reasons they 
can't quite put their finger on. 

This means the education is working.

If you think this sounds like brainwashing or like something straight out of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, you'd be wrong! Parents like you can actually configure the BraveNewBabyᵀᴹ Curriculum to conform to their own values.  For example, try opening up the code editor inside your BASIC BabyCam Mobile App and type the following:

\`\`\`
if [Smile]
  say "Going to college is important"
\`\`\`

And guess what? You just programmed your baby to go to college! Give the BASIC BabyCam a few more years pointed directly at your baby, and your child will grow up to smile whenever they think of the importance of higher education.

The BASIC BabyCam's state-of-the-art AI will also learn your baby's bathroom related cues, so you can write something like this:

\`\`\`
if [About to Poop]
  message_me "Code Brown incoming!!!"
\`\`\`

With a single line of code, dirty diapers become a thing of the past! 

You're probably thinking: I'm a busy parent; how can find the time to learn how to program my child's BASIC BabyCam? Don't worry! You don't have to. Our marketplace is filled with BraveNewBabyᵀᴹ programs written by parents like you. 

Popular choices are:

* Future Product Manager at Microsoft
* My Baby Knows All the AWS Acronyms
* Good Christian Baby
* I Will Vote Republican
* I Will Never Code in COBOL
* I Will Vote Democrat
* I Am Alpha
* I Am Beta

Again, you might be thinking that those last two sound like they are pulled directly from A Brave New World. You'd be right, but no one is forcing you to use them. With the re-programmable BraveNewBabyᵀᴹ Curriculum, we've democratized the ability for parents to program their children, which means that your child can be a good Christian product manager at Microsoft who never uses in COBOL, and the baby next door can be an Alpha who votes Republican.

The future is now. Program your baby according to whatever values were programmed into you! Or… be creative! It's your baby. It's your BASIC BabyCam!

### 4. TuringCompleteᵀᴹ Curriculum

While you're doing the hard work of installing cultural programming directly into your baby, the BASIC BabyCam will do its part to make sure that your baby learns a Turing-Complete programming language before they can walk. Here's how it works!

Remember when the BASIC BabyCam assigned meaning to things like the following?

* \`[Babble]\` - begin a section of code
* \`[Burble]\` - end a section of code
* \`[Babble][Squirm][*][Burble]\` - play \`[*]\` on the LCD screen

Now comes the exciting part. As your baby starts accidentally writing more and more complicated 
code, some of their programs may become quite long! So when the TuringCompleteᵀᴹ Curriculum kicks 
in, you'll start to see something new in your BASIC BabyCam Mobile App logs.

Instead of \`[Babble]\` and \`[Burble]\`, you'll see \`(\` and \`)\`. And instead of \`[Squirm]\` 
you'll see play. So, if your baby does this

\`\`\`
[Babble][Squirm][Fart][Burble]
\`\`\`

you'll see it printed like this in your BASIC BabyCam Mobile App's logs:

\`\`\`
(play [Fart])
\`\`\`

That's way shorter! Likewise, instead of an incomprehensible stream of nonsense like this

\`\`\`
[Babble][Drool][*][*][Burble]
\`\`\`

or this

\`\`\`
[Babble][Drool][Babble][*][*]...[Burble][*]...[Burble]
\`\`\`

you'll instead see a sleek printout like this

\`\`\`
(define * *)
\`\`\`

or this

\`\`\`
(define (* *...) *...)
\`\`\`

Did you see what the BASIC BabyCam did there? [Drool] was identified by the BASIC BabyCam as the perfect action (in your baby's unique BabyLanguageᵀᴹ) to represent the word define. 

Pop quiz! If the BASIC BabyCam decides that [Scowl] shall mean if, then what does the following become if written in our new, shorter notation?

\`\`\`
[Babble][Scowl][*][*][*][Burble] 
\`\`\`

That's right! It's:

\`\`\`
(if * * *)
\`\`\`

One more! If the BASIC BabyCam decides that [Hiccup] means quote, what is your baby writing if they do the following?

\`\`\`
[Babble][Hiccup][*]...[Burble]
\`\`\`

That's right! It's:

\`\`\`
(quote * ...)
\`\`\`

Now, your baby has the power to accidentally write a program like this at any time:

\`\`\`
(define [Fart]
  (quote [Laugh] [Wiggle] [Cry] [Laugh]))

(play [Fart])
\`\`\`

Your baby just accidentally taught the BASIC BabyCam that \`[Fart]\` now means
\`[Laugh] [Wiggle] [Cry] [Laugh]\`. It will now play this sequence of actions on the LCD screen 
whenever your baby writes \`(play [Fart])\`.

If you have your TuringCompleteᵀᴹ Curriculum level set to "Get my baby into MIT as soon as 
possible" (the default setting at the Silver and Gold levels), the BASIC BabyCam will waste no 
time finding the perfect BabyLanguageᵀᴹ actions for mathematical inequalities like 
\`=\` \`<\` \`>\` \`<=\` and \`>=\`, and for arithmetic operations like \`+\` \`-\` \`*\` and \`/\`, 
and (of course) for the digits \`0\`, \`1\`, \`2\`, etc. Thus, you could soon be waking up to find 
that your baby has written something like the following:

\`\`\`
(define ([Wiggle] [Shrug])
  (play [Fart])
  (if (= [Shrug] 1)
      (play [Funny Face])
      ([Wiggle] (- [Shrug] 1)))))

([Wiggle] 100)
\`\`\`

This, of course, plays \`[Fart]\` (as previously defined by your baby) 99 times before playing 
\`[Funny Face]\`.  

You might be thinking, "Hey! Isn't this language powerful enough to solve cool math problems? 
Why is my baby wasting time playing custom \`[Fart]\` videos?" Well, guess what! Your baby is 
just a \`[Babble]\` and \`[Burble]\` or two away from accidentally producing something like this!

\`\`\`
(define ([Smack Face] [Shrug])
  (if (<= [Shrug] 1)
      1
      (+ ([Smack Face] (- [Shrug] 1))
         ([Smack Face] (- [Shrug] 2)))))
\`\`\`

Mathematicians might claim this computes the \`nth\` Fibonacci number, but for the BASIC BabyCam 
and your baby, it computes the \`[Shrug]\`th \`[Smack Face]\` number! 

Remember, there are over 1,000 unique sounds, facial expressions, and gestures in your baby's 
unique BabyLanguageᵀᴹ, and your baby is able to compute the \`[Shrug]\`th \`[Smack Face]\` number 
with only a handful of them. Yep, it doesn't take much to have a Turing Complete language at your 
baby's disposal:

* \`(\`, \`)\`, \`define\`, \`if\`, and \`quote\`
* Math stuff:  \`=\`, \`<\`, \`>\`, \`<=\`, \`>=\`, \`+\` \`-\` \`*\` \`/\`, \`0\`,\`1\`,\`2\`,\`3\`,\`4\`,\`5\`,\`6\`,\`7\`,\`8\`, \`9\`.
* Misc: \`play\`

In due time, the BASIC BabyCam may add a few more:

* Logic stuff: \`true\`, \`false\`, \`and\`, \`or\`, \`not\` , and \`eq?\`

And that's it! No need for strings and characters in BASIC because the goal here is to get your 
baby coding long before they can spell. And there's no need for higher order functions 
(like \`map\` and \`fold\`) because these can obviously be derived by your baby when necessary.

> To those of you who have studied programming, it might seem like your baby is learning Lisp or 
Scheme, but we can assure you this is not the case. Your baby is just \`[Babbling]\` and \`[Burbling]\`. 
Our use of \`(\` and \`)\` in the output on the BASIC BabyCam Mobile App is merely "syntactic sugar" 
for your own reading convenience. Neither your baby nor the runtime of the BASIC interpreter 
really knows what a "parenthesis" is.

> That said, if you ever begin to suspect that your child has learned Lisp or Scheme, please 
open a ticket with our support team right away! Do not wait! Lisp is not comprehensible to 
the average programmer in Silicon Valley. Furthermore, Scheme was replaced by Python at MIT 
because Scheme was too difficult for the average undergraduate computer science major. 

> We understand that you want your baby to be above average, but please keep in mind that 
if your baby becomes a Lisp programmer, we cannot be held responsible for how the average 
programmers of the world will view your baby. (If your child's first word is "macro," you're 
already too late. Open that support ticket right away!)

Well, that's it for the TuringCompleteᵀᴹ Curriculum. When normal babies have accidents, it's 
poopoo and peepee. But when your baby has an accident, it could be poopoo, peepee, or code 
that simulates a Turing machine or two!

### 5. NoMoreAccidentsᵀᴹ Curriculum

You might be wondering, how will my baby begin to write programs that aren't just accidents? 

For millennia, infants of our species have progressed from verbal babbling to fully-formed 
words and sentences in a neurological process that remains shrouded in mysteries to this day.  
So too is the process of learning to code shrouded in mystery. With the NoMoreAccidentsᵀᴹ 
Curriculum, though, we train your baby with the same state of the art methodology used all 
the way from kindergarten to college lecture halls. 

It's a combination of three tried and true techniques:

* Lecture at students about "concepts."
* Point a bunch of coding problems directly at students.
* Make students figure things out on their own.

The lectures about "concepts" (i.e. ifs, loops, function definitions, etc.) will be seamlessly 
interwoven with messages from our advertising partners and Edsger Dijkstra. For example, if you 
listen closely at night, you may hear the softly voice of the BASIC BabyCam saying something 
like: "Trix are for kids. COBOL causes brain damage. And an if expression evaluates to one of two 
sub-expressions based on the runtime value of the given boolean expression." 

If you're worried that your baby doesn't know words like "branches" or "runtime" or "boolean," 
don't worry! Neither do college students when they take Intro to Programming. But decades upon 
decades of research convincingly show that if you point a lecturer directly at students for long 
enough, they often eventually graduate from college. 

Meanwhile the BASIC BabyCam's LCD screen will be hard at work displaying automatically 
generated programming "problems." For example, the screen might mysteriously begin to show a video 
of your baby doing a \`[Laugh]\` whenever they \`[Stretch]\` and a \`[Wiggle]\` whenever they 
aren't doing a \`[Stretch]\`. In other words the BASIC BabyCam has generated code like this 
in the background and is running it without telling your baby:

\`\`\`
(if [Stretch] [Laugh] [Wiggle])
\`\`\`

After a few hours of this, the LCD screen will go dark and the BASIC BabyCam will begin administering 
\`*beep boop!*\` rewards and \`*wamp wamp!!*\` punishments whenever your baby does (or does not) 
begin to write the program that was previously running. Hints will be given to your baby by the 
BASIC BabyCam when necessary. For example if your baby has done a \`[Babble][Scowl]\`, then they've 
written

\`\`\`
(if 
\`\`\`

And after a pause, the LCD screen may show a \`[Stretch]\` to help prompt your baby to continue 
writing the correct solution.

After a few years of these automatically generated problems, you can be sure that your baby will have 
been exposed to at least as many problems as the average college computer science major. 
And if you're worried that your baby might not have "gotten" most of the problems, don't be! 
Most college students just copy answers from StackOverflow anyway. And they still get hired.

Finally, the BASIC BabyCam leaves plenty of time for creative coding 
(i.e. letting your baby "figure it out on their own"). This is to avoid what often happens to 
undergraduates: they acquire such a debilitating case of post-coding stress disorder that they can 
only be convinced to continue doing it when large sums of money are involved. No, we want your 
baby to maintain their child-like love of coding as long as possible before becoming jaded and bitter.

This might all sound like magic, but then again, so is the process of learning to speak and 
write and do mathematics. The human brain keeps many secrets. 

So buy into the AI-driven, science-inspired, COPA-compliant BASIC BabyCam today. 
You know where to point it.

### Epilogue

As your baby grows, the BASIC BabyCam will too. For toddlers, we have a touch 
screen add on. For kindergartners, we have integrations with their favorite tablet apps. 
For kids in grade school, well… you get the point. 

As for college, your baby might not even need to go! The moment the BASIC BabyCam observes 
that your child's coding skills have reached "internship level," a message will be sent to 
the HR departments of several participating tech companies in Silicon Valley. You'll receive 
an interview request via text message on your phone. 

When this happens, we urge you to press "Accept." Your years of hard work have paid off! 
Tech recruiters will now be able to talk to your child through the LCD screen on the BASIC BabyCam. 

If your child performs well, the tech industry will take it from there, pointing your child 
directly at problems that generate enormous value for consumers and investors. Maybe your child 
will grow up to work on disruptive technology like the BASIC BabyCam itself! 

Some might call it the circle of life. But in coding, we just call it a loop.`
