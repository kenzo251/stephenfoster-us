`I use the magic of text editing to create fiction, non-fiction, and 
large-scale software systems.  

In graduate school at the University of California, San Diego, I did my Ph.D. 
research on end-user programmable 3D environments.  I still work in this space
today. 

For almost 10 years, my company [ThoughtSTEM](https://thoughtstem.com) 
made educational software and trained young computer scientists in 
San Diego.  Recently, I've relocated to the Seattle area to be near family.

I still make educational software (e.g. [LearnToMod](https://learntomod.com)
and [CodeSpells](https://codespells.org)).  I also do occasional contract work
if the project feels like it's on the cutting edge of science.  Don't pitch it
unless you honestly believe we're going to push the boundaries of what's
possible for people, computers, and society.

If you want to know about my educational philosophy, you should [read my book](/#/dont-teach-coding)
