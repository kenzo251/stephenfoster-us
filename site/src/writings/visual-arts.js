I've been an amature digital painter for a year or so now, so I was pretty surprised when I discovered how far AI art had come.  I hope to say more about that (and the ethical concerns around AI art) in future posts.

But for now, I'm just posting a few images that I generated in an experiment to see how viable Stable Diffusion is for generating cover art for books.  Here, are potential covers for a sci fi book about evil trees (various prompts).

`Personally, I like the last one best.  All of them have some potential, or evoke something weird and different.  It's a small experiment, but it's convinced me that AI art is an effortless, free way to explore a design space.  Much faster than painting them myself.`
