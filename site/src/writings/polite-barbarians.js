There once was a horde of polite barbarians known for their cunning use of Trojan horses to conquer cities while keeping bloodshed to a minimum. The mayor of one civilized city, hearing the polite horde was en route, ordered his knights: look out for suspicious packages.

The next morning, a giant wooden horse stood at the city gates, with a bow on top, ribbons gleaming in the first rays of light. The mayor ordered his archers to set it aflame. A few dozen barbarians scurried out of the burning wooden carcass, running for the woods.

The next day, the sun rose to find a stack of envelopes resting on the scorched earth where the Trojan horse's ashes still lingered. The knights who cautiously investigated discovered thousands of handwritten apology notes, one for each citizen of the walled city. The gist was:

>  We, the polite barbarians, apologize for the crudeness of yesterday's onslaught. Your mayor is a most clever man.
>  — The Horde


These were brought directly to the mayor who discovered, upon close examination, that the backs of the letters were filled top to bottom with invisible ink. It was pro-barbarian propaganda that spoke of the barbarian king's love of Latin and Greek literature, and of the barbarian horde's comfortable lifestyle. Needless to say, the mayor had the letters burned.

The next day the sun rose to find the mayor himself standing immobile outside his own gates! But when the knights investigated, they found it was not the mayor — but rather a wax statue, accurate down to the last detail of his expensive clothing, even his monocle and mustache. A plaque at the bottom read: A most clever man.

The archers were ready to torch it, but the mayor said the optics would be bad: the mayor melting in flames. Instead, after thorough inspection, he had it installed in the courtyard — a better message to the populace.

For a week, there were no deliveries — but the mayor dared not open the gates, for the nights were alive with barbarian drums. As the food supplies dwindled and the people began to whisper in the streets, the mayor sent riders to ask for help from the king. None of them returned.

Just as the grain silos were beginning to run low, the morning sun found carts of freshly baked bread at the city gates. Naturally, the mayor ordered the women and children to sample each loaf for poison before distributing the food to his knights. The next morning brought more bread, and no poison. And the next morning, the same. The scraps the knights left behind were given to the women and children.

Just as the hottest days of summer began to arrive, the morning bread deliveries ceased. In their place were carts full of gold and jewels — which the mayor ordered be brought to his personal treasure rooms for thorough inspection. So it was for weeks, the grain silos growing empty and the mayor's treasure rooms growing full. The people began to whisper in the streets again, casting the occasional insult at the wax statue, now drooping in the summer heat. To cut down on the whispering, the mayor began passing out gold coins, rubies, and emeralds — even to the poorest of the peasants.

The mayor promised great sums to any rider who would carry a message to the king. Many tried, but none returned.

By mid summer, the barbarians had set up a marketplace just outside of archery range, in the grassy fields before the city gates. There were lemonade stands and ice carts, vegetable vendors and cooks. A 24-hour bakery and butchery were erected, wafting the smell of fresh sourdough and fried chicken over the city gates morning and night. The prices were all prominently posted, and quite reasonable: one gold coin for a loaf of bread, a ruby for a cooked chicken, an emerald for three glasses of strawberry lemonade, a buy-one-get-one deal on potato salads, and so on. There were even discounts if you agreed to listen to a short presentation on barbarian history and culture at the small amphitheater erected in the middle of the market.

Although it was forbidden to leave the city walls, the children of the poor knew how to sneak over the walls in the dead of night. Occasionally, they were caught sneaking back with a loaf in every pocket, and glasses of lemonade in each hand. The mayor had these unlucky ones executed publicly, beside his now-sagging wax statue.

So it was for months, until finally, on the first day of winter, the king's cavalry arrived. Shining knights galloped across the grassy plane and laid waste to the thriving barbarian markets. The weary knights on the city walls cheered halfheartedly as the king's men set fire to the barbarian bakery and amphitheater. The peasants gathered in the courtyard and bowed their heads, listening mournfully to the sounds of the lemonade stands being razed, wood and glass obliterated by swords and hooves.

The mayor rode into the courtyard on his best horse, wearing his best jewels. The gates were opened to receive the king's cavalry. To everyone's surprise, the king himself led — wearing his traditional helmet and breastplate of gold. The peasants dropped to their knees and laid down their own gold and jewels, knowing these would be taxed away soon anyway.

The king and mayor dismounted and shook hands. The king, removing his helmet, turned out to be not the king everyone expected — but a rugged man wearing barbarian warpaint. “I am the barbarian king!” he announced. “And this is my horse, named Trojan, for I am a connoisseur of Greek literature.”

The horse’s rump, on closer inspection, was branded with the word “Trojan,” which in retrospect should have been a dead giveaway, but if any of the guards watching from the walls during the sacking of the barbarian market had noticed, none of them had made the connection.

He grinned at the mayor and said, "You are a most clever man."

“It’s not fair!” protested the mayor. “You sacked your own market!”

“I must commend you,” said the barbarian king. “We’ve never had to try so many different permutations of the Trojan horse tactic before. You burned our traditional wooden horse. You discovered our secret propaganda letters. You avoided the bad optics of destroying your own wax effigy. You never permitted your knights to venture out into the market — which was definitely a trap.”

“I knew it,” said the mayor, smugly.

“But…” The barbarian king gestured at the jewels laying on the ground in front of the peasants. “You did take the bread and jewels.”

“What was in the bread and jewels?” demanded the mayor. “I had them thoroughly checked.”

“Our hope was to destabilize your currency, undermine your political power, and incite a popular uprising,” said the barbarian king.

“Well it didn’t work,” said the mayor, smugly.

To the peasants, the barbarian king announced, “I’ll make you a deal. Keep your jewels! Tonight we feast! Drinks will be discounted! Or…” He paused. Weary peasants and knights leaned forward, holding their breath. “My horde and I will leave in peace — leaving your jewels, your mayor, your tax laws, and your very, very civilized, non-barbaric economic system intact.”

The peasants looked uneasily at each other. The mayor folded his arms, standing tall — in contrast with his stooping wax statue. He smirked.

Then one small voice, somewhere in the crowd murmured, “Wouldn’t mind a drink myself…” And suddenly the whole crowd was shouting eagerly about drinks and feasts and about making adjustments to the systems presently in place.

“Then let us drink!” roared the barbarian king. In accordance with the culture of the polite barbarians, he ran the mayor through with his sword and left the body beside the wax statue — now sagging almost to the ground. That night's victory feast could be heard for miles, matters having been politely resolved with minimal bloodshed.
