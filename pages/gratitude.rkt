					   It was with you and Sorin Lerner that [CodeSpells](https://codespells.org) was born.  Thanks for letting me take a risk on such a weird, weird project.  I'm grateful to have the chance to still be working on it now, so many years later.

					   * Our late nights and weekends spent designing Open Metagame

					   I wouldn't be half the coder I am today without you.  And thanks for being such a good friend.

					   To this day, I always make time to practice
